<!-- BANNER -->

Image Occlusion lets you create cards that **hide parts of an image** to test your knowledge of that hidden information. The cards generated by this add-on would be best described as **image-based cloze-deletions**:

### KNOWN ISSUES

- Due to compatibility issues between SVG-Edit and newer versions of Anki, some of the features in the masks editor no longer work correctly. My hope is to address these soon:
    + [Pointer not changing to selection mode when clicking on shape](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues/54)
    + [Path tool no longer working](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues/56)
    + [Shape library tool no longer working](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues/57)
- Please do not invoke the add-on's settings menu while the IO Editor window is still open. The same applies to modifying the Image Occlusion note type while an IO session is open. Both can cause trouble.

For any other issues you encounter please don't hesitate to a file a bug report on the [official bug tracker](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues) (preferred) or post on the [official support thread](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/image-occlusion-enhanced-official-support-thread/924/52). Your feedback is very much appreciated and welcome!

### USAGE

The use of this add-on is detailed in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/wiki) and a [series of video tutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MozITKTz5YFHDGB19ypxcYfJ1ITk_6o). Some of the screencasts and screenshots here were recorded on older versions of Anki and the add-on, but all the key usage tips should still apply.
